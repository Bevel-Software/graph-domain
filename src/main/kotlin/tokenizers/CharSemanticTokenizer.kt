/**
 * A [SemanticTokenizer] that tokenizes input code based on character types and simple operator rules.
 * It identifies sequences of alphanumeric characters (including underscores) as single tokens.
 * Whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, carriage return) act as delimiters.
 * Other characters are treated as individual tokens, with special handling for common two-character operators
 * like `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `&&`, and `||`.

class CharSemanticTokenizer: SemanticTokenizer {

    /**
     * Tokenizes the given input string into a list of semantic tokens.
     *
     * The tokenization process is as follows:
     * 1. Iterates through the input string character by character.
     * 2. Alphanumeric characters and underscores are accumulated into a current token buffer.
     * 3. Whitespace characters flush the current token buffer (if not empty) and are then discarded.
     * 4. Other characters (operators, punctuation) flush the current token buffer (if not empty).
     *    - If the character, combined with the next character, forms a known two-character operator
     *      (e.g., `==`, `!=`), that two-character sequence is added as a single token, and the iterator advances an extra step.
     *    - Otherwise, the single character is added as a token.
     * 5. After iterating through all characters, if the current token buffer is not empty, its content is added as the final token.
     *
     * @param input The string of code to tokenize.
     * @return A list of strings, where each string is a semantic token extracted from the input.
