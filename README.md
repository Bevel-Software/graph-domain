## Introduction

`graph-domain` is a Kotlin/JVM library, part of the Bevel suite of developer tools. Bevel's primary goal is to extract comprehensive knowledge graphs from codebases. This library provides the core domain model, data structures, and services necessary for representing, constructing, manipulating, and analyzing these code-derived graphs.

It defines entities like `Node` (representing code elements such as classes, functions, variables) and `Connection` (representing relationships like inheritance, usage, calls), along with services for parsing source code into these graph structures, merging different graph versions, and more.

## Relationship to Bevel and `file-system-domain`

The Bevel ecosystem is designed to understand and process software projects.
*   The [`file-system-domain`](https://github.com/Bevel-Software/file-system-domain) library (another Bevel component) focuses on standardized file system interactions, path resolution, and handling Bevel-specific project layouts.
*   `graph-domain` builds upon this by focusing on the *content* of the files within a project. It provides the tools to parse source code, represent its structure and semantics as a graph, and perform operations on this graph data.

Together, these libraries form a foundation for building advanced code analysis, visualization, and comprehension tools under the Bevel umbrella.

## Project Overview & Core Concepts

`graph-domain` offers a rich set of tools and abstractions for working with code graphs:

*   **Graph Representation**:
    *   `Node`: Represents a code element (e.g., class, method, variable, file). Each node has a `NodeType`, unique `id`, `simpleName`, `description`, location information (`LCRange` from `file-system-domain`), `codeHash`, and `nodeSignature`.
    *   `Connection`: Represents a directed relationship between two nodes (e.g., `USES`, `INHERITS_FROM`, `PARENT_OF`). Each connection has a `ConnectionType`, source/target node names, and location.
    *   `Graphlike` & `Graph`: Interfaces and classes for representing the entire graph structure, holding collections of nodes and connections.
    *   `ConnectionsNavigator` & `ConnectionsBuilder`: Interfaces for querying and constructing sets of connections.
        *   Key Implementations: `MutableMapConnectionsBuilder` (for building), `MapConnectionsNavigator` (immutable map-based view), and `ListConnectionsNavigator` (immutable list-based view).

*   **Graph Construction**:
    *   `GraphBuilder`: A central class for assembling `Graphlike` objects from various sources. Manages `NodeBuilder` instances and connections.
    *   `NodeBuilder` (Interface): Base for node construction.
        *   `FullyQualifiedNodeBuilder`: For nodes with complete information.
        *   `DanglingNodeBuilder`: Represents nodes encountered during parsing that are not yet fully resolved (e.g., an unimported type). Useful for progressive graph construction.
    *   `ImportStatement`: Represents an import statement found in source code, aiding in node resolution.

*   **Parsing Abstractions**:
    *   `Parser`: A high-level interface for parsing entire projects (potentially multi-language) into a `Graphlike` structure.
    *   `IntermediateFileParser` & `IntermediateStringParser`: Interfaces for language-specific parsers that transform file content or raw strings into an intermediate `GraphBuilder` representation.
    *   `ConnectionParser`: Interface for parsers that establish connections (e.g., call graphs, inheritance) between already identified nodes.
    *   `GraphUpdateParser`: Interface for parsers that can incrementally update an existing graph based on file changes (additions, modifications, deletions).
    *   `LanguageSpecification`: Defines language-specific properties like supported file extensions.
    *   `PotentialSymbol`: Represents an identifier (e.g., variable name, class name) found during parsing, along with its location, before it's turned into a full `Node`.
    *   `SupportedFileExtensions`: Data class to hold collections of file extensions, useful for filtering files for parsing.


*   **Graph Merging**:
    *   `GraphMergingService` (Interface): Defines a contract for sophisticated logic to merge two graph structures. Implementations would typically handle:
        *   Matching nodes based on ID, file path + signature, file path + simple name, or code similarity (using `LocalitySensitiveHasher`).
        *   Merging node descriptions, with mechanisms to flag conflicts or outdated information.
        *   Combining connections intelligently.

*   **Tokenization**:
    *   `SemanticTokenizer` (e.g., `CharSemanticTokenizer` could be an implementation): For breaking down code into meaningful tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators).
    *   `IdentifierTokenizer` (e.g., `RegexIdentifierTokenizer` could be an implementation): For extracting potential symbols/identifiers (`PotentialSymbol`) from code.

*   **Code Hashing & Similarity**:
    *   `LocalitySensitiveHasher` (Interface): For LSH algorithms, used by `GraphMergingService` implementations to compare code snippets for similarity when exact matches are not found.

*   **Graph Metrics**:
    *   `Metrics`: A utility class to compute and log various statistics about a graph, such as the number of nodes, connections, and types of nodes.

## Key Features

*   üî∑ **Comprehensive Code Graph Model**: Rich data structures (`Node`, `Connection`, `NodeType`, `ConnectionType`) for accurately representing diverse code elements and their relationships.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Graph Construction**: Builder patterns (`GraphBuilder`, `NodeBuilder` variants like `FullyQualifiedNodeBuilder` and `DanglingNodeBuilder`) for programmatic and step-by-step graph creation, including handling of `ImportStatement`s.
*   üîÑ **Advanced Graph Merging**: A defined interface (`GraphMergingService`) for combining graph data from different sources or versions, promoting strategies for conflict resolution and intelligent node matching.
*   ü§ù **Versatile Connection Management**: Robust interfaces (`ConnectionsNavigator`, `ConnectionsBuilder`) with concrete implementations like `MutableMapConnectionsBuilder` for efficient connection storage and retrieval.
*   üß© **Abstracted Parsing Framework**: A suite of parsing interfaces (`Parser`, `IntermediateFileParser`, `ConnectionParser`, `GraphUpdateParser`, `LanguageSpecification`) designed for extensibility, allowing support for various programming languages and custom parsing logic.
*   üìà **Incremental Graph Updates**: Support for updating graphs based on file system changes (`GraphUpdateParser`), essential for analyzing evolving codebases.
*   üîç **Semantic & Identifier Tokenization**: Interfaces (`SemanticTokenizer`, `IdentifierTokenizer`) and data structures (`PotentialSymbol`) for breaking down source code into tokens and identifying key symbols.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è **Code Similarity Analysis**: An interface (`LocalitySensitiveHasher`) for Locality Sensitive Hashing, aiding in tasks like refactoring detection or duplicate code analysis.
*   üìä **Graph Metrics**: Utilities (`Metrics`) for calculating and reporting statistics on graph structures.
