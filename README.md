## Introduction

`graph-domain` is a Kotlin/JVM library, part of the Bevel suite of developer tools. Bevel's primary goal is to extract comprehensive knowledge graphs from codebases. This library provides the core domain model, data structures, and services necessary for representing, constructing, manipulating, and analyzing these code-derived graphs.

It defines entities like `Node` (representing code elements such as classes, functions, variables) and `Connection` (representing relationships like inheritance, usage, calls), along with services for parsing source code into these graph structures, merging different graph versions, and more.

## Relationship to Bevel and `file-system-domain`

The Bevel ecosystem is designed to understand and process software projects.
*   The [`file-system-domain`](https://github.com/Bevel-Software/file-system-domain) library (another Bevel component) focuses on standardized file system interactions, path resolution, and handling Bevel-specific project layouts.
*   `graph-domain` builds upon this by focusing on the *content* of the files within a project. It provides the tools to parse source code, represent its structure and semantics as a graph, and perform operations on this graph data.

Together, these libraries form a foundation for building advanced code analysis, visualization, and comprehension tools under the Bevel umbrella.

## Project Overview & Core Concepts

`graph-domain` offers a rich set of tools and abstractions for working with code graphs:

*   **Graph Representation**:
    *   `Node`: Represents a code element (e.g., class, method, variable, file). Each node has a `NodeType`, unique `id`, `simpleName`, `description`, location information (`LCRange` from `file-system-domain`), `codeHash`, and `nodeSignature`.
    *   `Connection`: Represents a directed relationship between two nodes (e.g., `USES`, `INHERITS_FROM`, `PARENT_OF`). Each connection has a `ConnectionType`, source/target node names, and location.
    *   `Graphlike` & `Graph`: Interfaces and classes for representing the entire graph structure, holding collections of nodes and connections.
    *   `ConnectionsNavigator` & `ConnectionsBuilder`: Interfaces for querying and constructing sets of connections, with implementations like `MutableMapConnectionsBuilder`.

*   **Graph Construction**:
    *   `GraphBuilder`: A central class for assembling `Graphlike` objects from various sources. Manages `NodeBuilder` instances and connections.
    *   `NodeBuilder` (e.g., `FullyQualifiedNodeBuilder`, `DanglingNodeBuilder`): Used during the graph construction phase to represent nodes before they are finalized. `DanglingNodeBuilder` is particularly useful for handling unresolved references during parsing.

*   **Parsing Abstractions**:
    *   `Parser`: A high-level interface for parsing entire projects (potentially multi-language) into a `Graphlike` structure.
    *   `IntermediateFileParser` & `IntermediateStringParser`: Interfaces for language-specific parsers that transform file content or raw strings into an intermediate `GraphBuilder` representation.
    *   `ConnectionParser`: Interface for parsers that establish connections (e.g., call graphs, inheritance) between already identified nodes.
    *   `GraphUpdateParser`: Interface for parsers that can incrementally update an existing graph based on file changes (additions, modifications, deletions).
    *   `LanguageSpecification`: Defines language-specific properties like supported file extensions.

*   **Graph Merging**:
    *   `GraphMergingService` (`GraphMergingServiceImpl`): Provides sophisticated logic to merge two graph structures. This includes:
        *   Matching nodes based on ID, file path + signature, file path + simple name, or code similarity (using `LocalitySensitiveHasher`).
        *   Merging node descriptions, with mechanisms to flag conflicts or outdated information (e.g., `[OUTDATED] [NEEDS MERGE]`).
        *   Combining connections intelligently.

*   **Tokenization**:
    *   `SemanticTokenizer` (e.g., `CharSemanticTokenizer`): For breaking down code into meaningful tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators).
    *   `IdentifierTokenizer` (e.g., `RegexIdentifierTokenizer`): For extracting potential symbols/identifiers from code, along with their locations (`PotentialSymbol`).

*   **Code Hashing & Similarity**:
    *   `LocalitySensitiveHasher`: Interface for LSH algorithms, used by the `GraphMergingService` to compare code snippets for similarity when exact matches are not found.

*   **Graph Metrics**:
    *   `Metrics`: A utility class to compute and log various statistics about a graph, such as the number of nodes, connections, and types of nodes.

## Key Features

*   üî∑ **Comprehensive Code Graph Model**: Rich data structures (`Node`, `Connection`, `NodeType`, `ConnectionType`) for accurately representing diverse code elements and their relationships.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Graph Construction**: Builder patterns (`GraphBuilder`, `NodeBuilder`) for programmatic and step-by-step graph creation.
*   üîÑ **Advanced Graph Merging**: Sophisticated service (`GraphMergingService`) to combine graph data from different sources or versions, including conflict resolution for descriptions and intelligent node matching.
*   üß© **Abstracted Parsing Framework**: A suite of parsing interfaces (`Parser`, `IntermediateFileParser`, `ConnectionParser`) designed for extensibility, allowing support for various programming languages and custom parsing logic.
*   üìà **Incremental Graph Updates**: Support for updating graphs based on file system changes (`GraphUpdateParser`), essential for analyzing evolving codebases.
*   üîç **Semantic & Identifier Tokenization**: Tools to break down source code into tokens and identify key symbols.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è **Code Similarity Analysis**: Utilizes Locality Sensitive Hashing (`LocalitySensitiveHasher`) for comparing code fragments, aiding in tasks like refactoring detection or duplicate code analysis.
*   üìä **Graph Metrics**: Utilities for calculating and reporting statistics on graph structures.
*   üîó **Integration with `file-system-domain`**: Leverages `file-system-domain` for file path management and location tracking (e.g., `LCRange`, `LCPosition`).
*   üì¶ **Maven Central Availability**: Easy to integrate into any JVM project.

    import software.bevel.file_system_domain.LCPosition // From file-system-domain

    val myClassNode = Node(
        id = "com.example.MyClass",
        simpleName = "MyClass",
        nodeType = NodeType.Class,
        description = "A sample class.",
        definingNodeName = "com.example", // package

        codeLocation = LCRange(LCPosition(0,0), LCPosition(10,1)),
        nameLocation = LCRange(LCPosition(2,6), LCPosition(2,13)),
        codeHash = "abc123def456", // Example hash
        nodeSignature = "class MyClass"
    )
    ```

*   **`software.bevel.graph_domain.graph.Connection`**: Represents relationships.
    ```kotlin
    import software.bevel.graph_domain.graph.Connection
    import software.bevel.graph_domain.graph.ConnectionType
    import software.bevel.file_system_domain.LCRange

    )
    ```

*   **`software.bevel.graph_domain.graph.Graphlike` / `software.bevel.graph_domain.graph.Graph`**: Represents the graph.
    ```kotlin
    import software.bevel.graph_domain.graph.Graph
    import software.bevel.graph_domain.graph.builder.MutableMapConnectionsBuilder

    val nodesMap = mapOf(myClassNode.id to myClassNode /*, ... other nodes */)
    val connectionsBuilder = MutableMapConnectionsBuilder()
    connectionsBuilder.addConnection(usageConnection)

    val myGraph = Graph(nodes = nodesMap, connections = connectionsBuilder.build())

    ```kotlin
    // interface MyLangParser : IntermediateFileParser {
    //     override fun parseFile(pathToFile: String): GraphBuilder {
    //         // ... parsing logic for MyLang ...
